# PURPOSE
This is a copy of the ibm-container-service repo from ibm blockchain, but instead of ibmblockchain/composer related docker images, this references hyperledger docker images, corresponding to composer 0.16.5
The purpose of creating this is to be able to develop and test Composer deployment APIs against a composer playground environment 0.16.5 
IBM container service does not support 0.16.5. The ibmblocckhain docker images, which ibm-container-service script reference are available for composer 0.16.2 and then again 0.19.5
IBM IoT Blockchain transaction processor service is 0.16.5 compliant currently an d deploy fatures developed in the context of the same needed to be tested. This repo is expected to become obsolete as the trasaction processor service moves to version 0.19.5 or later of Hyperledger Composer. Once this is done, the repo can be safely removed.
